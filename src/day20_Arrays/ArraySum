Array: one of the three data structures
		size is fixed
		supports primitives & non-primitives
		can be multi-dimensional


	one dimensional array: array of elements
			[index Of Elements]

	multi-dimensional array: array of arrays. two or more dimensional ([][]..)
			[index of Arrays][index Of Elements]
			[][][]
			.....

			n dimensional array contains (n-1) dimensional array


Arrays: utility class for array. in "java.util" package

		toString()  :print array
		deepToString()   :print multidim array
		sort()  :order small to large
		equals()  :if equals
		copyOf()   :copy from first element
		copyOfRange()   :copy with range


String methods:
	toCharArray()  :if you want to get each of characters from string has array return char array
	split()   :string array return to string array


for each loop: already iterated, so it is faster
			    iteration order is fixed. so it doesnt go infinite.

			    THERE MUST BE A DATA STRUCTURE (Array, Collection, Map)
                Start from index 0. doesnt get index number, only gets element.
                Data type has to match array type(string-string, int-int)
                loops are powerful than for each loop, we can do everything for loop, not for each loop
			    for(DataType variable : Array){

			    }
