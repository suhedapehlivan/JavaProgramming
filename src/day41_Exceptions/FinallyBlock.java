        /*
        Interview Question:
Difference between final vs finally vs finalize.

final: is a KEYWORD for variables, methods, classes. and make them unchangeable.

finally: is a BLOCK. optional for tryÂ§catch (last block)  in exception handling. It always get executed, if we manually not terminate the program.

finalize: is a METHOD that the garbage collector calls it to destroy the object. It comes from Object class, and every object has finalize method.
